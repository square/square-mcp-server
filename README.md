# Square Model Context Protocol Server (Beta)

This project follows the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.com/) standard, allowing AI assistants to interact with Square's connect API.

## Quick Start

Get up and running with the Square MCP server using npx:

```bash
# Basic startup
npx square-mcp-server start

# With environment configuration
ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN SANDBOX=true npx square-mcp-server start

# local runs
npx /path/to/project/square-mcp-server
```

Replace `YOUR_SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual Square access token. You can obtain your access token by following the guide at [Square Access Tokens](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/access-tokens). You can also set environment variables before running the command.

## Remote MCP Server

Square now offers a hosted remote MCP server at:

```
https://mcp.squareup.com/sse
```

The remote MCP is recommended as it uses OAuth authentication, allowing you to log in with your Square account directly without having to create or manage access tokens manually.

## Configuration Options

| Environment Variable | Purpose | Example |
|---------------------|---------|---------|
| `ACCESS_TOKEN` | Your Square API access token | `ACCESS_TOKEN=sq0atp-...` |
| `SANDBOX` | Use Square sandbox environment | `SANDBOX=true` |
| `PRODUCTION` | Use Square production environment | `PRODUCTION=true` |
| `DISALLOW_WRITES` | Restrict to read-only operations | `DISALLOW_WRITES=true` |
| `SQUARE_VERSION` | Specify Square API version | `SQUARE_VERSION=2025-04-16` |

## Integration with AI Assistants

### Goose Integration

To configure the Square MCP Server with [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/):

#### Remote MCP
To install the Square remote MCP in Goose, click this URL on a computer where Goose is installed:

[goose://extension?cmd=npx&arg=mcp-remote&arg=https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.squareup.com%2Fsse&id=square_mcp_production_remote&name=Square%20MCP%20Remote&description=Square%20Production%20MCP%20Remote](goose://extension?cmd=npx&arg=mcp-remote&arg=https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.squareup.com%2Fsse&id=square_mcp_production_remote&name=Square%20MCP%20Remote&description=Square%20Production%20MCP%20Remote)

Or copy and paste the URL into your browser's address bar.

```bash
# Automatic installation
npx square-mcp-server install

# Get URL for manual installation
npx square-mcp-server get-goose-url
```

The `install` command automatically updates your Goose configuration.

### Claude Desktop Integration

For Claude Desktop integration, see the [Model Context Protocol Quickstart Guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user). Add this configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### Remote MCP
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_square_api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.squareup.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

This approach allows you to authenticate directly with your Square account credentials without needing to manage access tokens.

#### Local MCP
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_square_api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["square-mcp-server", "start"],
      "env": {
        "ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "SANDBOX": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool Reference

## Usage Pattern

For optimal interaction with the Square API through MCP:

1. **Discover**: Use `get_service_info` to explore available methods
   ```
   get_service_info(service: "catalog")
   ```

2. **Understand**: Use `get_type_info` to learn parameter requirements
   ```
   get_type_info(service: "catalog", method: "list")
   ```

3. **Execute**: Use `make_api_request` to perform the operation
   ```
   make_api_request(service: "catalog", method: "list", request: {})
   ```

## Development and Debugging

### Using MCP Inspector

The [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) provides a visual interface for testing:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the inspector with the Square MCP Server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js start
```

### Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development mode: `npm run watch`
4. Run the server: `node dist/index.js start`
5. Test your changes using the MCP Inspector
